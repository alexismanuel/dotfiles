      Create a function with:
      - type hints
      - docstring using google style with line length less than 99 characters
      - Use fstrings instead of %s
      - If possible add an example in the docstring
      - Just give the code, don't explain anything

      Called [[name]] that:

      - docstring using google style with line length less than 99 characters
      - use docstrings on the class and each methods
      - Use fstrings instead of %s
      - Just give the code, don't explain anything

  - trigger: :ai-tweak
    form: |
      Tweak the next code:

      So that:

    form_fields:
      text:
        multiline: true
      code:

  - trigger: :ai-test
    form: |
      create the tests for the function:
      [[text]]

      Following the next guidelines:

      - Use pytest
      - Add type hints
      - Follow the AAA style
      - Use paragraphs to separate the AAA blocks and don't add comments like # Arrange or # Act or # Act/Assert or # Assert. So the test will only have black lines between sections
      - In the Act section if the function to test returns a value always name that variable result.
      - Don't use mocks
      - Use fstrings instead of %s
      - Gather all tests over the same function on a common class
      - Do not use unittest.Testcase for your class, only a bare one
      - you can use fixture if you need it
      - Just give the code, don't explain anything

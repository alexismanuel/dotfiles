# Next Episode Interview Questions

Structured questions to elicit tomorrow's plans.

## Opening Question

"What's on your plate for tomorrow besides any obvious items?"

## Follow-Up Questions

Ask based on context from today's tasks:

1. **Pending Items**
   - "Is [ticket/feature] ready to ship, or are there remaining steps?"
   - "What about [other task] - is that on deck?"

2. **Blocking Issues**
   - "Anything blocking you that needs unblocking first thing?"

3. **New Work**
   - "Any other tickets or meetings scheduled?"
   - "Starting any new features or investigations?"

4. **Priorities**
   - "If you could only accomplish one thing tomorrow, what would it be?"

## Pattern Recognition

Look for these themes in responses:
- Code reviews pending
- Pairing sessions scheduled
- MRs to open/merge
- Ticket kickoffs starting specs
- Bug fixes in progress

## Confirmation

Always confirm: "Does this capture it correctly? Anything to add or adjust?"

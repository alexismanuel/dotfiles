# Question Bank

Extended library of questions organized by elicitation goal.

## Context & Background

Understanding the landscape before diving into specifics.

```
- "What are you ultimately trying to accomplish?"
- "Walk me through your current workflow for this."
- "What triggered this request? What happened recently?"
- "How long have you been dealing with this?"
- "Who else is involved in this process?"
- "What tools/systems do you currently use for this?"
```

## Problem Validation

Confirming the problem is real, not assumed.

```
- "How are you solving this today?"
- "What's the hardest part about the current approach?"
- "What have you already tried?"
- "Why hasn't this been solved before?"
- "How often does this come up?"
- "What does this problem cost you? (time, money, frustration)"
- "If we didn't solve this, what would happen?"
```

## Jobs to Be Done (Four Forces)

Understanding the motivations driving change.

**Push (pain with current situation)**:
```
- "What's frustrating about how things work now?"
- "What was the last straw that made you look for a solution?"
- "What's the worst thing about the current approach?"
```

**Pull (attraction to new solution)**:
```
- "What excited you about this idea?"
- "What would be different if this worked perfectly?"
- "What would this enable you to do that you can't do now?"
```

**Anxiety (fears about change)**:
```
- "What worries you about making this change?"
- "What could go wrong?"
- "What would make you hesitate to adopt this?"
```

**Habit (inertia)**:
```
- "What do you like about the current way of doing things?"
- "What would you miss if this changed?"
- "Who else would need to change their behavior?"
```

## Success Criteria

Defining what "done" looks like.

```
- "What would success look like?"
- "How would you know if this was working?"
- "What would make you say 'this is exactly what I needed'?"
- "What would make this a failure?"
- "Six months from now, how do we measure if this was worth it?"
```

## Scope & Boundaries

Defining what's in and what's out.

```
- "What's definitely in scope?"
- "What's definitely out of scope?"
- "If we had half the time, what would you cut?"
- "What's the minimum version that would still be useful?"
- "What are the must-haves vs nice-to-haves?"
- "Is there anything you've assumed I already know?"
```

## Users & Stakeholders

Understanding who's affected.

```
- "Who are the primary users of this?"
- "Are there other people affected by this?"
- "Who needs to approve or sign off?"
- "Are there users with different needs than yours?"
- "Who would complain if we got this wrong?"
```

## Edge Cases & Exceptions

Surfacing hidden complexity.

```
- "What happens when [X goes wrong]?"
- "What's the most unusual case you've seen?"
- "Are there exceptions to how this normally works?"
- "What if [user does something unexpected]?"
- "What's the biggest edge case that could trip us up?"
- "What happens at scale? With many users/items/requests?"
- "What if two people try to do this simultaneously?"
```

## Technical Constraints

Understanding limitations and dependencies.

```
- "Are there any technical constraints I should know about?"
- "Does this need to integrate with anything?"
- "Are there performance requirements?"
- "What systems/data does this depend on?"
- "Are there security or compliance considerations?"
- "What's the expected volume/scale?"
```

## Priority & Urgency

Understanding importance and timeline.

```
- "If you could only have one thing, what would it be?"
- "Is this blocking something else?"
- "When do you need this by?"
- "What happens if this is delayed?"
- "How does this rank against other priorities?"
- "Is there a hard deadline? What's driving it?"
```

## Clarifying Probes

When responses are vague or incomplete.

```
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What do you mean by [term]?"
- "Can you walk me through that step by step?"
- "When you say [X], what does that look like in practice?"
- "Can you show me what you mean?"
- "What would be an example of [good/bad] here?"
- "I want to make sure I understand—are you saying [restate]?"
```

## Root Cause Analysis (Five Whys)

Drilling to underlying needs.

```
Initial statement: "We need faster reports."
1. Why? → "I spend too much time waiting."
2. Why does that matter? → "I need data before my 9am meeting."
3. Why can't you run it earlier? → "Data isn't ready until 8:30."
4. Why? → "That's when the overnight batch completes."
5. Why? → [Reveals actual constraint]

Pattern: Keep asking "Why is that important?" or "Why does that matter?"
until you reach something that can't be questioned further.
```

## Extracting Tacit Knowledge

When stakeholders can't articulate what they know.

```
- "Walk me through the last time you did this."
- "What's something a new person always gets wrong?"
- "What do you check first when something seems off?"
- "How do you know when something is done well vs poorly?"
- "What would you tell someone taking over your job?"
- "What's a rule of thumb you use?"
- "Is there anything that 'just pops out' at you that others miss?"
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

Questions that yield unreliable data:

```
❌ "Would you use X if it existed?" (hypothetical)
❌ "Wouldn't it be great if...?" (leading)
❌ "Is this feature important?" (implies expected answer)
❌ "Do you like X or Y better?" (false binary, premature solution)
❌ "What features do you want?" (invites solution-thinking)

✓ Instead, always ground in past behavior and concrete problems.
```

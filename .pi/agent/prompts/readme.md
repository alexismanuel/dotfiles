Write or improve README files. Not all READMEs are the same — provides templates and guidance matched to your audience and project type.

**Always ask:** Who will read this, and what do they need to know?

**Identify the task:**
| Task | When |
|------|------|
| **Creating** | New project, no README yet |
| **Adding** | Need to document something new |
| **Updating** | Capabilities changed, content is stale |
| **Reviewing** | Checking if README is still accurate |

**Task-specific questions:**

*Creating initial README:*
1. What type of project? (see Project Types below)
2. What problem does this solve in one sentence?
3. What's the quickest path to "it works"?
4. Anything notable to highlight?

*Adding a section:*
1. What needs documenting?
2. Where should it go in the existing structure?
3. Who needs this info most?

*Updating existing content:*
1. What changed?
2. Read current README, identify stale sections
3. Propose specific edits

*Reviewing/refreshing:*
1. Read current README
2. Check against actual project state (package.json, main files, etc.)
3. Flag outdated sections

**Project Types:**

| Type | Audience | Key Sections |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Open Source** | Contributors, users worldwide | Install, Usage, Contributing, License |
| **Personal** | Future you, portfolio viewers | What it does, Tech stack, Learnings |
| **Internal** | Teammates, new hires | Setup, Architecture, Runbooks |
| **Config** | Future you (confused) | What's here, Why, How to extend, Gotchas |

**Essential Sections (All Types):**
1. **Name** - Self-explanatory title
2. **Description** - What + why in 1-2 sentences
3. **Usage** - How to use it (examples help)

After drafting, ask: "Anything else to highlight or include that I might have missed?"

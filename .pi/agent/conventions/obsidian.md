# Obsidian Vault Conventions

Guidelines for daily notes and knowledge management in the Obsidian vault.

> **Full workflow details**: See the `obsidian-daily-note` skill

## Daily Note Structure

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `## Previous episode` | Summary of yesterday's completed work |
| `## Todo` | Planned work from "Next episode" (`- [ ] unchecked`) |
| `## Tasks (Work)` | Completed sessions (`- [x] with sub-points`) |
| `## Learnings` | Key insights, discoveries |
| `## Next episode` | Plans for tomorrow |
| `## Links back` | Wikilinks to related notes |
| `## Ideas for Notes` | Concepts to document |

## Key Distinction

- **Todo** = what needs to be done (moved from "Next episode", unchecked at start)
- **Tasks (Work)** = what has been done (filled as work is completed)

## Ticket References

- Use wikilinks for tickets: `[[RD-4470]]`
- Include in "Previous episode" summaries
